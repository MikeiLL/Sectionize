tatums
: list of tatum markers, in seconds. Tatums represent the lowest regular pulse train that a listener intuitively
infers from the timing of perceived musical events (segments).
‣
beats
: list of beat markers, in seconds. A beat is the basic time unit of a piece of music; for example, each tick of
a metronome. Beats are typically multiples of tatums.
‣
bars
: list of bar markers, in seconds. A bar (or measure) is a segment of time defined as a given number of beats.
Bar offsets also indicate downbeats, the first beat of the measure.
‣
sections
: a set of section markers, in seconds. Sections are defined by large variations in rhythm or timbre, e.g.
chorus, verse, bridge, guitar solo, etc. Each section contains its own descriptions of tempo, key, mode,
time_signature, and loudness.
